== Silent Mix Fan ==

This repo contains a sketch to control a 14 cm Noctua fan to exhaust bedroom air, CO2 dependent.

A central HRV can now extract from wet rooms (bathroom, washing room, toilets) and supply to a central staircase/hallway where the mixfans exchange fresh air. 
This way, no supply ducting is required, greatly simplifying installation and maintenance (duct cleaning).

The fan I used is a Noctua NF-A14x25r G2 PWM, a 12V fan that starts reliably at 5V and allows PWM control using its PWM input.
This makes it quite silent, suitable for a bedroom.

My wall is 10 cm thick; a 168mm core drill makes a nice round hole for the fan while allowing standard exhaust grills.
The fan can be mounted without screws using 10-15mm thick foam in the hole.
